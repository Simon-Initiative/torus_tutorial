00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.319
Now let's add some pages.

1
00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.700
To create a new page,

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.809
start by selecting 'Practice' in this box.

3
00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.010
Once selected,

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.550
a new page will appear here.

5
00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.079
If you want to add a page inside a specific unit,

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.819
module,

7
00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:14.819
or section,

8
00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.959
simply click on the container

9
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.600
and just create a page here.

10
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:25.409
A practice page is intended for ungraded activities,

11
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.329
allowing learners to engage with the content

12
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.250
without impacting their scores.

13
00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:31.920
In contrast,

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.220
a scored page

15
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.779
is used for graded activities,

16
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:37.310
such as assessment,

17
00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:38.150
checkpoints,

18
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.139
and exams.

19
00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:40.680
You will notice that

20
00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:45.939
practice pages and score pages have distinct icons in your curriculum list.

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.619
These icons help you easily differentiate

22
00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:52.090
between content types and track the structure of your course.
