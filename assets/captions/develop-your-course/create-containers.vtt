00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.400
The curriculum tab in the course author menu is where

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.440
you will edit your course structure and course content.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.469
Remember,

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.779
Torus follows a default hierarchy

4
00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.800
of units,

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.600
modules,

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.619
sections.

7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.260
Where a unit contains multiple modules,

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.670
a module can contain multiple sections.

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.829
Units,

10
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:19.540
modules,

11
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.090
and sections can all contain pages with course content.

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.389
If you want,

13
00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.219
you can rename these containers and overview

14
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.100
to better fit your course structure.

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.780
To set the structure of your course,

16
00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.659
you can start by creating a unit.

17
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.439
Click

18
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.909
"create a unit",

19
00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:39.810
your unit will be created

20
00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.830
with the default name "Unit1: Unit".

21
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.049
Torus numbers the units automatically.

22
00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.369
As to create or rearrange more units,

23
00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:52.090
Torus will update the numbering accordingly.

24
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.029
To change the name of the unit,

25
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.930
click the drop down menu

26
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.450
and click "options",

27
00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.049
then change the title

28
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:01.770
and click "save".

29
00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.069
Inside your unit,

30
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.629
you can create a module.

31
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.779
Following the same steps you use to create a unit,

32
00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:12.730
then inside of the module,

33
00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:14.400
you can create a section.

34
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.230
Again following the same steps you use to create a unit.

35
00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:20.779
You can create as many units,

36
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.440
modules and sections as you need for your course structure.

37
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.980
You can also create pages at any level of the structure.

38
00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.220
Inside of a section,

39
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.900
a module,

40
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.580
a unit,

41
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.080
or at the top level of your curriculum.
