In accordance with Learning Engineering practices,

1
00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:07.110
all pages should generally have learning objectives.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.170
You have already seen how you can create

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.189
learning objectives from the learning objectives page.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.689
At the top of each content page in a tourists course,

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.909
you can select

6
00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.829
or create learning objective for that page.

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.069
If you already created a learning objective that you want to map to the page,

8
00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.750
you can select and attach it by checking the box beside in the drop down menu.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.369
You can also create a new learning objective here

10
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.430
by directly typing it in the learning objectives bar

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.669
and clicking

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.049
create new objective when you're done.

13
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:43.060
You can have multiple learning objectives on the same page.
